# BudgetCreator
This is the Budget Creator I am making in JavaScript for my internship at ArmgaSys.

It is created using:
* HTML
* Bootstrap 4
* JavaScript (ES6 concepts)
* DOM manipulation

It was semi-difficult at first to find out what I wanted to do for the internship, but I asked my friends and they said I should do something that has real world applications

That was where this idea came from! A budget helper to try and allow people to make a very simple budget.

I hope you enjoy looking at it!
